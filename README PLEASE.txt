Thank you for downloading my game!

I do not have the money to take this to a professional printer right now, so you are going to have to print out the cards yourself. 

The cards are formatted to be printed on A4 paper and are all the same layout, so if you have something that can cut through 21 pages of A4 paper at once you should be fine.

There are currently no card backs. Card backs are not essential to playtesting, and I couldn't figure out how to do them, so they're not there right now. You'll have to keep track of or label your cards yourself.

If you have any issues with the printing process, please email me at bearsharktopusdev@gmail.com. Additionally, if you really really want a printed version that you can just get a box of without having to go through the trouble, send me an email saying that too, it'll help me gauge demand.

Happy hauntings!
