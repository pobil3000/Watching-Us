I've passed the Watching Us sheet throught the Google Translator Document Translator (GTDT), then edited the thing that were messed up. 
Notice that most of the cells start with a space, that is a GTDT problem, i don't know how to remove it automatically. 

Document naming: 
_tr_mod.ods means that it's my modification of the GTDT document. 


Traductions that involved "creative decisions", regarding the Google translation:
